### pre-simulation

~ := research/implementation/simulation/

execute: ~/tools $ perl mkdir.pl

	outcome: creates directories for *.cnf sweep
			 SET_002, SET_004, ... SET_200
	comments: Each *.cnf within a SET contain fixed ratio r = m/n
			  For example, SET_004, holds formulas with r = 0.4

execute: ~/ $ perl buildGenerate.pl

	outcome: compiles ksat.c, and executes over the sweep parameters
		r := [2, 200],  by +=2
		k := 3
		n := {
		m := {
		s := [0, 1000), by +=1
		
		ksat k n m s > ~/data/SET_00r/SWEEP_r_k_n_m_s.cnf
		
	comments: takes approximately 15-20 minutes on single core

### test

execute: ~/ $ perl buildTest.pl




	
### simulation	
	
execute: ~/ $ perl build.pl

	options:
		-l		--- run Lipton's algorithm
		-o		--- run Ogihara's algorithm
		-d		---	run Distribution	~ algorithm
		<n>	--- start at specified serial 
	outcome:
		default: 
			Simulate each of the algorithms for each SWEEP_*.cnf
			located in ~/data/
		options:
			if any algorithm option is specified, then only specified 
			algorithms will be executed
		
			Example: $ perl buildSimulate.pl -L -S 0
				Will execute Lipton, Split-Mix over all SWEEP_*.cnf

			Example: $ perl buildSimulate.pl 0
				Execute from 0 (default)
