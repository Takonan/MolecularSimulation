---------------------------------------------------------------

--- Overview

This directory contains the source to MolecularSimulation, a simulation
environment for experimentation with DNA computation.

Three molecular algorithms to solve Satsfiability are included in the
implementation.  These are:

	Liptons's algorithm 			(Brute force) 
	Ogihara and Ray's algorithm 	(Branching heuristics) 
	Distribution algorithm			(Constructive)

--- License

Molecular Simulation is released under the MIT license.  

See LICENSE for details.


---------------------------------------------------------------
--- Usage

Several build scripts are included for building and executing the
simulation environment.

To build the file execute:

$ perl build.pl <options>

For automated build and execution of all sub directories of DIMACS *.cnf

$ perl runSimulation.pl -p <Directory>

	---	runSimulation.pl will generate output for the status of the expression.

--- Modifications

If you plan to modify the environment or create molecular experiments,
then you should visit the project page at:

	www.cs.rit.edu/~dnc6813/project/generated/index.html

This site provides full documentation about all files.  Details of the
implementation is described and extensions can be introduced.  This
could be your own molecular algorithm using the DNA, dna32, oligo, and
gel datatypes.

Extending these definitions operating with larger molecular structures
could be done to map:

	DNA <--> RNA <--> Protein,

describing the central dogma of molecular biology.

Note that the DNA is defined as an enumeration as a self complementary structure.  

	A 	--- 	00
	C	---		01
	G	---		10
	T	---		11
	
Notice that:
	
	complement(A) = T
	complement(C) = G
	complement(G) = C
	complement(T) = A

Due to the behavior of RNA, we could extend our representation to 

	000		A
	001		C
	010		G
	011		T
------------------
	100		A		(directed from T), complement as U
	101		C
	110		G
	111		U

providing a self complementary structure.  Next, we may synthesize the 
representation of proteins from DNA and RNA.
